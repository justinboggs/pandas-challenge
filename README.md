The following folder contains the "Heroes of Pymoli" challenge. The .csv data contains the following fields: Purchase ID, SN, Age, Gender, Item ID, Item Name, and Price. The jupyter notebook file, HeroesOfPymoli_starter, contains multiple dataframes to analyze the data contained in the .csv file. 


After analyzing the data, the following trends are obervable:
1. The male gender makes up the majority of purchases at 84.03%. Second is the female gender at 14.06% and gender marked as "Other / Non-Disclosed" makes up a little less than 2%.
2. Item price seems to have no bearing on the purchase frequency, as the average of the game prices are in the low $3.00 range. If this range was larger, we may see more of a trend based on price.
3. People in the age range 20-24 make up almost 45% of all purchases, with the age group 15-29 comprising almost 77% of all purchases. A lot of questions coome from this observation. Do people lose interest in video games around the age of 30? Are gamers in their 20's purchasing the optional experience-enhancing items more often due to the enhancement each item gives to the game? Would people in their 30's rather stay with the base game?
4. A category based on the task each item performs would be very helpful. Does the item make the game more fun to play, does it make it easier? Does it add levels to the game? This may tell us more about the frequency with which each item is purchased. This would also help determine which items to add for purchase in the future to facilitate more purchases by the end user.
